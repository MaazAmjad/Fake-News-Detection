# Fake-News-Detection
---
The challenge to combat the menace of fake news is essential for the maintenance
of authenticity of various media sources. We have used machine learning 
and natural language processing to identify the fake news which can be 
used to combat the fake news problem. 

## We have used two models in our project:-
* Attention Integrate(AI) model
* 3HAN (Hierarchical Attention Network)

We have focused on using the attention mechanism to check the relevancy of words and
sentences in the articles. We merged the context info from both headlines and
articles to decide the genuineness of the article.
